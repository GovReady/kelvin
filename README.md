_The determination of temperature has long been recognized as a problem of the greatest importance...The theory of thermometry is however as yet far from being in so satisfactory a state._ - [Lord Kelvin, 1848](http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_an_absolute_thermometric_scale.html)

A cool experiment in measuring FISMA compliance

# Hypothesis
DevOps can incorporate security scanning into continuous delivery in a way that improves the security review cycle and shortens time to FISMA compliance.

# Experiment Design
Build an XCCDF (checklist) for some portion of 800-53 guidance applied to NGINX.

# Included Virtual Machines
The `vm` directory includes virtual machines for learning and testing GovReady. 

`vm/basic` provides for a multiple virtual machine environment for testing GovReady. 

`vm/basic/vbkick-templates` provides vbkick virtual machine configuration files for building VirtualBox VM's from source ISO and kick start files.
